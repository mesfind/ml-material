## What is a Fingerprint?

Deep learning models almost always take arrays of numbers as their inputs. If we want to process molecules with them, we somehow need to represent each molecule as one or more arrays of numbers.

Many (but not all) types of models require their inputs to have a fixed size. This can be a challenge for molecules, since different molecules have different numbers of atoms. If we want to use these types of models, we somehow need to represent variable sized molecules with fixed sized arrays.

Fingerprints are designed to address these problems. A fingerprint is a fixed length array, where different elements indicate the presence of different features in the molecule. If two molecules have similar fingerprints, that indicates they contain many of the same features, and therefore will likely have similar chemistry.


## DScribe

DScribe is a Python package for transforming atomic structures into fixed-size numerical fingerprints. These fingerprints are often called "descriptors" and they can be used in various tasks, including machine learning, visualization, similarity analysis, etc.   The libary introduce the descriptor and demonstrate their basic call signature. We have also included several examples that should cover many of the use cases.

 - Coulomb Matrix
 - Sine matrix
 - Ewald sum matrix
 - Atom-centered Symmetry Functions
 - Smooth Overlap of Atomic Positions
 - Many-body Tensor Representation
 - Local Many-body Tensor Representation
 - Valle-Oganov descriptor

DScribe provides methods to transform atomic structures into fixed-size numeric vectors. These vectors are built in a way that they efficiently summarize the contents of the input structure. Such a transformation is very useful for various purposes, e.g.

  - Input for supervised machine learning models, e.g. regression.
  - Input for unsupervised machine learning models, e.g. clustering.
  - Visualizing and analyzing a local chemical environment.
  - Measuring similarity of structures or local structural sites. etc.

The above example employs atomistic descriptors to generate machine-readable representations of small inorganic molecules—H₂O, NO₂, and CO₂—using the DScribe library. Two distinct types of descriptors are utilized: the **Coulomb Matrix (CM)** and the **Smooth Overlap of Atomic Positions (SOAP)**. The CM provides a global, rotation- and permutation-invariant representation of each molecule, encoded as a fixed-size vector of dimension $ n_{\text{atoms}}^{\text{max}} \times n_{\text{atoms}}^{\text{max}} $, here flattened to a 9-dimensional vector after sorting by L2 norm to ensure consistency across configurations. This representation is suitable for regression tasks targeting global molecular properties such as total energy.

In contrast, the SOAP descriptor offers a local, chemically rich description of atomic environments, computed specifically for oxygen atoms across all structures. Due to the variable number of oxygen atoms per molecule (one in H₂O, two in NO₂ and CO₂), the resulting descriptors are structured as a list of arrays, later concatenated into a unified feature matrix of shape (5, 3696), where each row corresponds to an oxygen-centered environment and columns represent the high-dimensional SOAP basis expansion ($ n_{\text{max}} = 8 $, $ l_{\text{max}} = 6 $). This localized approach enables atom-centered machine learning models, including those predicting partial charges, chemical shifts, or reactivity.

Furthermore, analytical derivatives of the SOAP descriptor with respect to atomic positions are computed, enabling the prediction of forces in energy-conserving machine learning potentials. These derivatives are returned per center and per Cartesian direction, forming a hierarchical structure suitable for integration into gradient-based learning frameworks.

The use of parallelization via the `n_jobs` parameter demonstrates scalability for larger datasets. Overall, this work establishes a reproducible pipeline for generating physically meaningful descriptors from molecular geometries, forming a foundation for subsequent applications in quantum property prediction, potential energy surface construction, and interpretative analysis in computational chemistry and materials informatics.

## Coulomb Matrix (CM) 

 Coulomb Matrix (CM)   is a simple global descriptor which mimics the electrostatic interaction between nuclei. Coulomb matrix is calculated with the equation below.

\begin{split}\begin{equation}
M_{ij}^\mathrm{Coulomb}=\left\{
    \begin{matrix}
    0.5 Z_i^{2.4} & \text{for } i = j \\
        \frac{Z_i Z_j}{R_{ij}} & \text{for } i \neq j
    \end{matrix}
    \right.
\end{equation}\end{split}

In the matrix above the first row corresponds to carbon (C) in methanol interacting with all the other atoms (columns 2-5) and itself (column 1). Likewise, the first column displays the same numbers, since the matrix is symmetric. Furthermore, the second row (column) corresponds to oxygen and the remaining rows (columns) correspond to hydrogen (H). Can you determine which one is which?

Since the Coulomb Matrix was published in 2012 more sophisticated descriptors have been developed. However, CM still does a reasonably good job when comparing molecules with each other. Apart from that, it can be understood intuitively and is a good introduction to descriptors.
